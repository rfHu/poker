POOL BOSS PLUGIN - By Dark Tonic, Inc. (c) 2014

-Code by Brian Hunsaker

-V 1.1.2 - Fixed compile errors in Unity 2017 beta.

-V 1.1.1 - Fixed compile error in Unity 5.5
		 - Fixed max qty mismatch in Pool Boss Inspector.
		 - Fixed error in PrefabIsInPool method.
		 - Fixed bug in PoolBossDespawn Playmaker Custom Action that would not despawn 2 different objects if the property changed.

-V 1.1   - Moved all classes into a namespace. If you are using code to call the API, you will need to add "using DarkTonic.PoolBoss;" at the top of those classes you use it in.
 		 - Fixed the namespace on Playmaker Custom Actions. If you are using these, you will need to re-import the new package or it will not compile.
	     - Added NextPoolItemToSpawn method which will give you the next available item in a pool.
		 - Removed random pool item selection. Now it always uses the first available.

-V 1.0.8 - Updated to the very latest in Core GameKit, complete with categories, spawned/despawned counts and more!

-V 1.0.7 - Fixed Unity 5.3 warning.

-V 1.0.6 - Fixed Unity 5.1 warning.

-V 1.0.5 - Fixed rare bug with Spawn not finding the item if despawned before.

-V 1.0.4 - Updated Playmaker custom actions. There was a compile error.

-V 1.0.3 - Add ability to spawn by name instead of passing in a Transform. This should prove useful when I get the Bolt Network compatibility working!
		 - Added drag area to create multiple items at once by dragging them into the box when locking the Inspector.
		 - Updated UI to look better. Matched with our other plugins' new UI colors and grouped boxes.

-V 1.0.2 - Fixed warnings in the Console that occur if you spawn and despawn elements with the new uGUI components.

-V 1.0.1 - All example files and Pool Boss prefab were broken. Meta files weren't set up in the project. Now fixed!

-V 1.0 - Submitted 10/21/2014 on the Asset Store
